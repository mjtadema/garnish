def garnish(file="topol.top", selection='all', gmx=None, fix_elastics=1, guess_prot=1, show=1):
    """
DESCRIPTION

    Allow a coarse grained structure to be visualized in pymol like an atomistic structure
    by drawing bonds and elastic network.

    Without a top/tpr file, this function only adds bonds between the backbone beads
    so they can be nicely visualized using line or stick representation.
    Adding a top/tpr file provides topology information that can be used
    to draw side chain and elastic bonds.

USAGE

    garnish [file [, selection [, gmx]]]

ARGUMENTS

    file = a tpr or topology file to extract bond information from (default: None)
    selection = any selection to act upon (default: all)
    gmx = gmx executable path (default: inferred by `which gmx`)
    fix_elastics = fix elastic bonds based on atom id. Disable if your beads are
                   numbered non-sequentially (default: 1)
    guess_prot = if file is not present, simply draw bonds between backbone atoms of a protein (default: 1)
    show = adjust representation after drawing bonds (default: 1)
